Let me remember the most important events that have form mindsets inside existing economical system. That is just 3 major events. But that is how contemporary </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1tGWATv&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF1SaNlPuMpzJDTM-BGUfeCq9ZtGA">Religions</a></span><span>, </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1rUz2KS&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHxhdEUMqUKeE8rbQClUwdoJDMwiw">Politics</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1qbAKGe&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEuCE7Qt7lFb96JZTFC-0UbtpUhww">World economy</a></span><span>&nbsp;came. </span></p><h3 class="c9 c16"><a name="h.4llhvewtok19"></a><span>Roman Law. ~449 BC</span></h3><p class="c9"><span>Roman Law was ingenious in terms of community intelligence or politics with </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1CMIwus&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF58_sZ1ljRo96rkD73Nmw1N4jYmg">separation of powers principle</a></span><span>. 3 branches: Executive, Legislative and Judicial. That system works with slight differences in the core of any existing nation level systems. This systems was born too early and peoples was in need with something much more simple to Trust. Trust = Capitalization with weak proof. &nbsp;Maybe that is why:</span></p><h3 class="c9 c16"><a name="h.2iwgnued20z4"></a><span>Jesus birth. ~AC</span></h3><p class="c9"><span>Every time something happens that make new belief. </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1s9AmY9&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEF1ms3q-0HRR3Da1CWfKJ7EohNUg">Jesus</a></span><span>&nbsp;give the world one strong concept that widespread the planet: Faith.

History of religions is obvious cause human was need something to believe even he couldn&rsquo;t explain this. And that was great. That was moved the Science forward. Why? Because religion is ingenious in terms of business modeling. Faith generated revenue automagicaly for centuries. Peoples bring money themselves. Faith = Capitalization without proof. Such religion. So much wow. But people became smarter century after century making politics more powerful than religion. Why? Because peoples have learned to trust.</span></p><h3 class="c9 c16"><a name="h.wnek7lhel1ni"></a><span>Fractional Banking Reserving. ~1600 AC</span></h3><p class="c9"><span>Nature abhors a vacuum.

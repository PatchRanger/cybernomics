# Artificial intelligent networks

<span>Artificial intelligent networks</span></h1><p class="c9"><span>Artificial Intelligent Network or AIN or, simply, global brain - cybernetic system which follows 6 fundamental principles: existence of meaning, cryptographic proof, digital value, efficient communications, self-consciousness and equilibrium. First AIN ever existed is Bitcoin. For 5 years of Bitcoin existence was born 500 AINs only in visible part of </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FP8E5EY&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHZ9dc3kdf9rK5_KbRMeJZinQt6oQ">Digital Universe</a></span><span>. For simplicity let us define any AIN as </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1BpbLBY&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH7rorY7jqJ6PEVWbiaJVGE0-mN5A">global brain</a></span><span>&nbsp;with understanding that AIN is significantly more perceived than previous perception of global brains concept. </span></p><p class="c9"><span>But how can we define something as intelligent if there is no common definition of what the intelligence is? If we assume that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency systems is global brains and just summarize all founded patterns we can try to define it. And the most exciting that the same definition could be applied to intelligence in general no matter is it artificial or biological. Let us try? Intelligence is an entity self-aware itself with existence of meaning by proving these meaning through finding values via efficient communications and tending to equilibrium :-)</span></p><p class="c9"><span>Simple case: typical white collar. He wakes up early in the morning. </span></p><ul class="c15 lst-kix_nav8ocnmnhpa-0 start"><li class="c9 c19"><span>Why? He wants to take care of his family (Meaning).</span></li><li class="c9 c19"><span>How? He needs to go to work (Proof). </span></li><li class="c9 c19"><span>Purpose? He wants to earn money (Values). </span></li><li class="c9 c19"><span>Means? Through (Efficient communications). </span></li><li class="c9 c19"><span>Meaning? To survive and eventually reach harmony (Equilibrium). </span></li></ul><p class="c9"><span>Simple? And there is self-consciousness? Self-consciousness makes that all works. Try to reflect about yourself. That is how systems like Bitcoin works. Comes to mind popular joke from The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy: </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FZfzZAQ&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHjwko9FMgpeVrC2-UzReWu0-2_7Q">What is the answer to life the universe and everything?</a></span><span>&nbsp;We still do not want to accept that the only meaning is harmony or equilibrium. There is natural mechanism within our intelligence that force us to find our own meaning. And then meaning is found what happens? We need to prove it. We begin to earn money. But the only way to earn money is efficient communications no matters what you do. And what is the meaning in everything we do? Eventually to reach harmony. It looks like that recursive probabilistic semantic calculations in our brains induce us to find the answer that already have been found.</span></p><h2 class="c9"><a name="h.33n0gp6gx049"></a><span>Intelligence in Science</span></h2><p class="c9 c43"><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1waTKHn&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE2b7G6cZslCGsAY1Ns8jhuEa7teg">Cryptography</a></span><span>, </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1tqx0hy&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEn9oRzWO2Ixru7ecp3Anidm_AM4Q">Computer Science</a></span><span>, </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FWD3FWD&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGh5hPsokTixTaIS3hiTb-jxN0f-g">Economy</a></span><span>, </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1tH9GA3&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEd-v_TuQhd2AsjT99Am8_HcwagZg">Cybernetics</a></span><span>, </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1rzPDxq&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFEttzdzzG-S8dk74rvbuqQ2pzZ6A">Mathematics</a></span><span>, </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1xCQF4x&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG8c4I_r2pUcdihf_TPzEPSo3qZ2w">Psychology</a></span><span>, </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1tqAsZB&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFvHcSVbzAUrQxqnnR5b3p_ov0qDw">Neuroscience</a></span><span>&nbsp;and, of course dozens years of </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FWLGHNj&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEzImYqA4UjD8nD3fQEryx0RYpL1w">Engineering</a></span><span>.

At the beginning Satoshi published the paper. This paper was self-sufficient to find followers. After releasing a code the system begin to live by itself independently. That gives us brilliant idea that there is a way for any scientist to find a proof for any work in much more intelligent way. With cybernetic business framework there is easy way to find followers for writing code together. After launching of the system theory will prove itself through the most ancient mechanism - survival. There is no followers? So there is no proof. Code does not live by itself? That is not the science. Very simple. Such approach could fill the gap between money and science.</span></p><p class="c9 c34 subtitle"><a name="h.u3vbx87rsirj"></a><span class="c63">Axiom:</span><span class="c54">&nbsp;</span><span class="c70">The code that can live is the Science, the code that is dead - not.</span></p><p class="c9 c43"><span>Let me warm up your appetite with some sweets.

After genesis block was created Satoshi became richer on 50 bitcoins. Truth? No. Why? Because nobody value these 50 bitcoins except Satoshi. Than these value appears?

How that could happens? Because Hal was running bitcoin client. Some energy was wasted, work was proved and value have been appeared for Satoshi and Hal. There was some common meaning for each.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c63">Axiom:</span><span class="c54">&nbsp;</span><span>Value appears then some meaning is proved</span></p><p class="c9"><span>Another argument in a Bitcoin piggy bank. </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1tI7lVL&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF6SpY7dOIgMASuA7yDK1izBR7nmw">Double-entry bookkeeping system</a></span><span>&nbsp;that was born 5 centuries ago is in the core of existing financial and economic system. All existing values live in databases within these simple principle. No wonder why it is in the core of Bitcoin protocol. That fact makes understanding of new generation protocols easier by all existing professionals.</span></p><p class="c9"><span>Technically everything that could be valuable live in cryptocurrency networks in tokens. That&rsquo;s just passwords that doesn&rsquo;t store anywhere in raw format except people brains (forget about bad apps that control you Private key). That&rsquo;s the only reason why people say about this kind of systems as trustless systems. But we use to think about value as something that has certain legally-physical form: money, asset, currency, equity, property or whatever you like. In cybereconomy the only difference between different types of value in program logic of the value. Every type of value programmed to behave like physical analog. That is the most interesting part of our story. Property was something that drove humanity all the road. But how tokens could be perceived as true property?</span></p><h3 class="c9 c16"><a name="h.sxftt69ovl7t"></a><span>Cybermoney</span></h3><p class="c9"><span>The most important thing in user adoption is to explain how basic public-key cryptography works in Bitcoin. After understanding everything become obvious. That is like enlightenment moment for everybody. My explanation how it is works in 5 easy steps:</span></p><ol class="c15 lst-kix_mk7k3kqcx276-0 start" start="1"><li class="c9 c19"><span>Than you create your wallet very loooong password is generated and shows only for you. This is your Private key. It doesn&#39;t store anywhere. That is the only information you need to keep for having access to your money. That is your password and this is your money and values. You can store your money even in your brain keeping Private key there!</span></li><li class="c9 c19"><span>Public key it is a number. Like your bank account. You can show it everywhere to send money. Public key stores everywhere and everybody can see it. Public key is calculated from your Private key using special formula or algorithm so there is no efficient way to calculate it back. That is just a math.</span></li><li class="c9 c19"><span>Then you want to spend your money you sign your spending with your Private key and send transaction to network. Network check that you have this money that you declare to send and that you do not want to spend your money twice.</span></li><li class="c9 c19"><span>All spending records live in database signed by every participant with their Private keys as indestructible &#1089;hain of blocks. And this database (blockchain) is storing and automatically synchronizing with almost every participant of a system. So blockchain is just exist and accessible for everybody.</span></li><li class="c9 c19"><span>The whole system is open source, there is no emission center and there is nobody to trust. </span></li></ol><p class="c9"><span>That simple explanation works. Even my mom have managed. She is 64. So then somebody understand how trustless system works and that this system is just a math he or she begin to perceive bitcoins as medium of exchange. This is first important step in user adoption.</span></p><p class="c9"><span>The second step is much more exciting: possession and perception as store of value. My experience shows that after trying bitcoins and ensuring how easy and cool to feel full control of your money Bitcoin could be begin to perceived as store of value. That fact could turn on cognitive processes of property possession. We need to ensure that it could be used as store of value. What arguments could be here? </span></p><p class="c9"><span>Simple explanation is users. Everybody knows that Facebook is $200 bln company because it has more than 1 bln user. That is simple math. Bitcoin has ~2 mln. users and capitalized in ~$8 bln. Also simple math. The internet has more than 3 bln users. Also simple. Everybody who use internet can use Bitcoin right now. Try to calculate capitalisation yourself adding network effects. Simplicity, transparency and perspective shoot any questions concerning perception as store of value and turn on the most exciting cognitive processes: perception as capitalization growther. That fact dramatically change behavior of intelligent agent. Key factor that intelligent agent understand that more people use Bitcoin, the more capitalization it has. So everybody who possess bitcoins promote it. Otherwise not. That gives me brilliant idea that Bitcoin being digital property change behaviour like land or real estate. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c63">Axiom: </span><span>Cyberproperty change human behavior like the physical one.</span></p><p class="c9"><span>Bitcoin as medium of exchange and store of value is more clear for those who possess it. &nbsp;But this is just first two steps of adaption. There is at least 3 more: perception as capitalization growther, revenue generator and agent that works.</span></p><h3 class="c9 c16"><a name="h.j03k9ul0bbhn"></a><span>Cybershares</span></h3><p class="c9"><span>How could something growth in capitalization if it doesn&#39;t work as medium of exchange and store of value? Again simple answer! It should generate revenue.</span></p><p class="c9"><span>3 things: </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1rBXU42&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEjqS6T0IWFWEH0cY9D1VyGjcPiZA">proof-of-existence</a></span><span>, </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="#h.3u2qat6vszla">cybernetic business framework</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="#h.j103opxelwqm">proof-of-origin</a></span><span>&nbsp;described by this paper later makes cryptotokens excellently function as tool for revenue generation and growthing of value. Cybershares is the next big thing that could shake billion of existing businesses working as strong motivation for entrepreneurs contribute to global intelligence remaining certain about reliability of system, present and future value. Intelligent agents who understand this begin to perceive digital or cybershares as property with all inherent consequences of changing behaviour.</span></p><h3 class="c9 c16"><a name="h.um40v0e8u18k"></a><span>Cyberproperty</span></h3><p class="c9"><span>Flexibility and reliability that gives us public-key cryptography gives us one more brilliant idea. It could be used as tool for controlling emerging zoo of robots no matter hardware or software. In fact this is further future. At least then Ethereum came. But in terms of agent perception through process of adoption understanding that intelligent networks could be suppliers of artificial agents (software or hardware) is strong factor that drives cognitive process of entrepreneurship capabilities to the sky. </span></p><h3 class="c9 c16"><a name="h.qxdleb6dcvvm"></a><span>Intangibility vs tangibility</span></h3><p class="c9"><span>Liquidity and accessibility for everybody makes new generation intangible or cybervalues at least not less viable than tangible. But the most promising thing that public-key simplicity for access and cashflow management will lead that any stuff like cars, homes, robots, phones, screens, music players and even land plots could be with its own public address. So no reason to choose between tangibility and intangibility. &#1057;ombination of both.</span></p><p class="c9 subtitle"><a name="h.24ufq1wn2snd"></a><span class="c55">Hypothesis: </span><span class="c67">All existing property will evolve to cyberproperty.</span></p><p class="c9"><span>So we can conclude that digital value is inherent part of artificial intelligent networks that turns on essential cognitive processes among intelligent agents.</span></p><h2 class="c9"><a name="h.6bx6cbew2uy2"></a><span>Efficient Communications</span></h2><p class="c9"><span>Everybody love to communicate. That is the reason why the internet became so popular. Though </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1AvxDJm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFt4sKlKeMwj3i2NqZAPPQWb45ang">informational entropy</a></span><span>&nbsp;is also very complicated topic its obvious that entropy reduction in communication is significant source of efficiency in economic relations. We distinguish 3 key principles that is used in cryptocurrency networks, available today and &nbsp;in fact is root of emerging efficiency of global brains.</span></p><h3 class="c9 c16"><a name="h.pxog246f9xwz"></a><span>Peer to peer</span></h3><p class="c9"><span>Anybody could communicate with anybody without third parties peer to peer. Bitcoin and any future intelligent networks will follow this principle. Restriction access to information and ability to communicate significantly increase entropy of any communication and as result reduce intelligence capabilities. </span></p><h3 class="c9 c16"><a name="h.q6u93mi3rdth"></a><span>Open Data</span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1qJCtAs&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGt6Kkf92D2-RXP1YHLZDLoaBIfnw">Block chain</a></span><span>&nbsp;- the big thing behind it is practical solution to </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1qJCtAs&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGt6Kkf92D2-RXP1YHLZDLoaBIfnw">Byzantine general problem</a></span><span>. That was big problem of trustless communications. Solution of this problem could have so huge impact that consequently eliminate any meaning of wars. Using simple words it is more efficient to outwit enemy than trying to brute force. &nbsp;But block chain has at least one impactful side effect - </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1uiVADP&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEXHq1z1wSyWnzifOTl0_KpkN63bQ">open data</a></span><span>. In recent years interest in open data concept has increased significantly because data is bottomless pit for improvement efficiency of anything. Then data is open it is mean that anybody have opportunity to improve efficiency. That concept that anybody have ability to know everything significantly reduce informational entropy in planet scale.</span></p><p class="c9"><span>Existing internet industry have one big stumbling block to flourish open data concept - open users or intelligent agents data. Every domain control their own user base and behavioral data through cookies. Also Google control this dataset inasmuch as </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1wfgqn9&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHhsEmLaK4mz-VWW8d1vbkDSlhHPQ">Universal Analytics</a></span><span>&nbsp;lives in almost 80% of the internet domains. So the biggest problem now is cookies. How to liberate the internet? Easy answer - replace cookies with public keys. But how to motivate site owners to switch to concept of open user data? How to explain this concept for peoples who use it? Again simple answer - efficiency. Site owners can easily switch to public keys complementing their web apps with disruptive digital property capabilities and users could accept this approach because new generation apps have capabilities that legacy apps don&#39;t have. Moreover - new generation apps are cheaper and in fact erase border between user, shareholder, customer etc. If you use some app - you is the integral part of it. That is big thing. Win to win. </span></p><p class="c9"><span>Public Key instead of cookies - that is very innovative concept. What this mean for peoples, business, developers and marketers? That mean that digital marketing will dramatically evolve in parallel with finance to more open and free internet. In existing digital marketing the first step in funnels is a user acquisition. Registering all users in blockchains will affect digital marketing landscape with unbelievable consequences: transparent, open and accurate world scale audience and no millions of passwords for every site. In case of this scenario come true real-time bidding (</span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1p3TDET&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH7O3Y1Rp1R3yoKkHN6rfiVBK4mJw">RTB</a></span><span>) can evolve to one of the biggest markets ever existed. So open data is strong factor that will crash existing digital marketing landscape. Open click-level data will allow global brains to optimise funnels steps with amazing speed and quality. There is no chances to compete with projects that use this approach course efficiency of such approach is obvious and could be even more powerful than Open source.</span></p><p class="c9 subtitle"><a name="h.z7pe092k7ivo"></a><span class="c102">Hypothesis:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c67">Public Key will replace cookies in all browsers in 5 years.</span></p><p class="c9"><span>cyber&bull;Fund will prove this hypothesis by developing </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1luAKQI&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH4Ue8cn_5GKlKuzdoVewOMAgqzoA">Jah</a></span><span>&nbsp;- embeddable open wallet that supports any type of digital property.</span></p><h3 class="c9 c16"><a name="h.rxi1bguly49x"></a><span>Open Source</span></h3><p class="c9"><span>Open source is phenomenon for which we should be grateful to </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FYunAsx&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH3MKVArGrmZZd-i-KYX59bhR1tMQ">Richard Stallman</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1wfhpDO&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEW-nL0D_YZYq0Dr4b7K8Z0H_wBnw">Linus Torvalds</a></span><span>.

That system appears after complicated learning process. Analyzing cryptocurrency networks in terms of global brain concept, we come to a surprising inference. Global brain is able self-aware itself through self-awareness of every neuron (human or intelligent agent) as the integral part of global brain. The next question could be somewhat: what is the reason for every neuron (human or intelligent agent) to behave these way? Windmills of </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1p3UMwe&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGwsmk4yFop05mR0Uzm20XJh9hdLQ">Nash</a></span><span>&nbsp;mind already found the answer:</span></p><h2 class="c9"><a name="h.hftwfirdkvd6"></a><span>Equilibrium</span></h2><p class="c9"><span>Though </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1sdA3f1&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHrfK9gySd-7_JfCUe1dwJMY0T-Dg">almost every science</a></span><span>&nbsp;has defined balanced state of the system, existing human social-economy system still do not have strict definition applied to cybernetics and cryptocurrencies.

Between left and right. Between man and woman.

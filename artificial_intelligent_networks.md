# Artificial intelligent networks

Artificial Intelligent Network or AIN or, simply, global brain - cybernetic system which follows 6 fundamental principles: existence of meaning, cryptographic proof, digital value, efficient communications, self-consciousness and equilibrium. First AIN ever existed is Bitcoin. For 5 years of Bitcoin existence was born 500 AINs only in visible part of [Digital Universe](http://bit.ly/P8E5EY). For simplicity let us define any AIN as [global brain](http://bit.ly/1BpbLBY) with understanding that AIN is significantly more perceived than previous perception of global brains concept.

But how can we define something as intelligent if there is no common definition of what the intelligence is? If we assume that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency systems is global brains and just summarize all founded patterns we can try to define it. And the most exciting that the same definition could be applied to intelligence in general no matter is it artificial or biological. Let us try? Intelligence is an entity self-aware itself with existence of meaning by proving these meaning through finding values via efficient communications and tending to equilibrium :-)

Simple case: typical white collar. He wakes up early in the morning. 

* Why? He wants to take care of his family (Meaning).
* How? He needs to go to work (Proof). 
* Purpose? He wants to earn money (Values). 
* Means? Through (Efficient communications). 
* Meaning? To survive and eventually reach harmony (Equilibrium). 

Simple? And there is self-consciousness? Self-consciousness makes that all works. Try to reflect about yourself. That is how systems like Bitcoin works. Comes to mind popular joke from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: [What is the answer to life the universe and everything?](http://bit.ly/ZfzZAQ) We still do not want to accept that the only meaning is harmony or equilibrium. There is natural mechanism within our intelligence that force us to find our own meaning. And then meaning is found what happens? We need to prove it. We begin to earn money. But the only way to earn money is efficient communications no matters what you do. And what is the meaning in everything we do? Eventually to reach harmony. It looks like that recursive probabilistic semantic calculations in our brains induce us to find the answer that already have been found.

<h2 class="c9"><a name="h.rpg6a24tbvpt"></a><span>Cyber entrepreneurs</span></h2><p class="c9"><span>Who are these guys? That is entrepreneurship of 3d millennium. These guys doesn&#39;t have limitations unlike traditional. They do not need to register entities. They can use notary with one click. Their accounting work automagicaly on blockchains. Their finance is transparent and trustees as never seen before. They have multisig to safe transaction and governance. The have best minds through collaboration in distributed way. They do not have any borders at all. They architecting businesses that can work by itself dramatically reducing operational cost. They can fund personal trust based capital with one piece of paper instead of expensive due diligence to get to listing. They are free to build corporations of their dreams. That is all ALREADY POSSIBLE and that is all small part of what is possible eventually. </span></p><p class="c9"><span>3 years ago we thought that bitcoin is finance revolution. 2 years ago become obvious that bitcoin is engineering revolution with pack of algorithms and proofs. 1 year ago we scented management revolution with DAOs.

Hm... Traditional business already starts from paper. Charter or constituent agreement or something else depending on jurisdiction. Purpose of traditional documents is to clear agreements between shareholders and guarantee their rights. How can we achieve this purpose issuing shares in cyberspace? There is an answer. By publishing paper with proof of existence you can ensure your shareholders that:</span></p><ul class="c15 lst-kix_rr0v5ebgh7n7-0 start"><li class="c9 c19"><span>your business is unique and first. In case of successful emerging of community future network effects could guarantee that probability of losing market significantly decrease. Newcomers has more incentive to join existing strong community than meaningless compete.</span></li><li class="c9 c19"><span>future cash flows from declared meaning will flow to genesis address or system of addresses published in paper. This genesis address is starting point and base for any future due diligence, compliance, auditing, self-control or whatever you can imagine.</span></li><li class="c9 c19"><span>every shareholders have common vision on business and means of achieving it. Traditional initial paper lacks of real business informations.

What is DAO? DAO happens every time then only 1 girl or guy decide to code some logic with computer code. This code needs shares to distribute future revenue that this code generate.

And this is moment than DAO happens.</span></p><p class="c9"><span>In computer industry there was a lot of </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1qD6PG3&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFAJ_5rcZ6Omj8UETYkpdJr6TBzQw">clouds</a></span><span>&nbsp;before. Cloud computing is nice. But space much more further and harder to reach. Cloud computing have ability for some authority to stop computing, but for space computing that is impossible. Such a difference. That is there the code will work - in space. While in fact that code will physically work somewhere on our planet and nobody will know on what computer it will run. That is cool. If code is meaningful and could bring value, peoples begin to believe in this code generating revenue and distributing shares with each other. Value of code growths as growth revenues from this code and values inside every human brain. So code can work until at least 1 brain believes in these particular code. If some stupids begin to yell that that is bad, so - okey - prove it. We </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FVHzONa&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHCu3obiPsjHbxgnVigktIA36Kldw">already proving</a></span><span>&nbsp;a lot of things. We can help you to learn technology behind. But there is no way to prove that this is impossible to build such kind of systems just in fact that this systems already exist and rapidly grow. That is amazing power of nature and we can observe some similarity happenings in nature that we cannot control: hurricanes, earthquakes, lightning bolts and a lot of stuff that comes from space.</span></p><p class="c9"><span>David R. Weinbaumin infers: The challenge of bringing about the global brains is not a matter of explicit design but rather in creating the proper circumstances for its emergence as a continuous process of self organization and make system. Cryptocurrencies gives us creative power for providing this proper circumstances. That paradigm shifts all future decentralized autonomous organisations to more powerful concept - artificial intelligent networks or global brains. The only thing lacking is understanding of every participant of how global brain works, why it is works and how to continuously improve system by personal effort. Lets get down to programming principles.</span></p><h3 class="c9 c43 c16"><a name="h.r96wzxkq7y19"></a><span>Meaning</span></h3><p class="c9"><span>We can define meaning in terms of cybernetic business framework as a way of making something more efficient. Efficiency is the most important element in cybernetic economy. Intelligent agents brings value only into more efficient meaning. No efficiency - no meaning. Everybody can find millions of meaning by means of CBF within any area of economic relations.</span></p><h3 class="c9 c43 c16"><a name="h.mjlw0dytnu3o"></a><span>Story</span></h3><p class="c9"><span>Story is a vision. Picture of the future that can inspire and focus intelligent agents. Every business book and success story shows that the most successful companies had clear vision. Why? After some step accomplished every intelligent agent needs something that will self-direct each other for the next step. That is the vision. </span></p><h3 class="c9 c16"><a name="h.khbg0q8473bh"></a><span>Metaphor</span></h3><p class="c9 c34"><span>Why we suggest to use global brains instead of artificial intelligent networks? Global brains is more understandable as well as much more explored. But the main reason is that global brain is great metaphor that puts necessary meaning inside object. This summer on Google I/O was presented new and shiny </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FWFjsEd&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEH4NFRF882bA3ebDYeg9X-S5MSXg">Material design</a></span><span>. Very smart engineers have used this metaphor for putting obvious and indestructible sense of what is efficient via decision making of those engineers who will design with material design. We propose to use metaphors for any control element in designing of global brains. That will allow intelligent agents understand the purpose of elements faster and more precious.</span></p><h3 class="c9 c16"><a name="h.rlyv6aa77f84"></a><span>Gamification</span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c79 c67">Wikipedia say that </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FGamification&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHsl6TmpOEMDyP5XOJ3Ul6eMcduqQ">gamification</a></span><span class="c8 c87"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FGamification&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHsl6TmpOEMDyP5XOJ3Ul6eMcduqQ">&nbsp;</a></span><span>is the use of game thinking and game mechanics in non-game contexts to engage users in solving problems. Gamification techniques strive to leverage people&#39;s natural desires for socializing, learning, mastery, competition, achievement, status, self-expression, altruism, or closure. Early gamification strategies use rewards for players who accomplish desired tasks or competition to engage players. Types of rewards include points, achievement badges or levels, the filling of a progress bar, or providing the user with virtual currency. Gamification is one of the best way to improve effectiveness of motivation programs. You receive the rewards for the completed tasks, it&rsquo;s make you happy and make a result for community. Use it everywhere. We&rsquo;ve used gamification even in Genesis Sale Race programs. Life is a Game.</span></p><h3 class="c9 c16"><a name="h.kj8vqelbf3ff"></a><span>Fair distribution</span></h3><p class="c9"><span>Fair distribution is inherent part of success. Why? In open environment everything could be copied fast and redistributed fairly. Moreover if something was distributed unfairly there is high probability that this values do not perceived as valuable for every intelligent agent within the system. That fact prevent turning on necessary cognitive processes for every participant.</span></p><h3 class="c9 c16"><a name="h.1so6zbt14lmk"></a><span>Funding </span><span class="c78">vs</span><span>&nbsp;and Development</span></h3><p class="c9"><span>Some guys say that no product - no investments. Trendy </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1AvQP9P&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHHhORVJ4oWDib-id-g2_Cj3d4FkQ">growth hacking</a></span><span>&nbsp;demonstrate power of marketing first concept. Traditional problem of chicken or the egg. Evolution suggests that smarter do it as parallel iterative processes. No meaning to develop product that market doesn&#39;t needs. No meaning to market product that couldn&#39;t be efficiently developed. Simple. Cybernetic business framework is approach than marketing meets development. Genesis Sale Race is tool for any entrepreneur to check meaningful of his efforts.</span></p><h2 class="c9 c94"><a name="h.fk57tbvnt7px"></a></h2><h2 class="c9"><a name="h.zt9gaedtuv4"></a><span>Cashflow engine</span></h2><p class="c9"><span>Cashflows. That is the most exciting part of cybernetic business framework. &nbsp;In CBF we use cashflows as attention mechanism. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c9"><span>Let me cite useful thought from </span><span class="c8"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1lhJQjp&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG4CnsLe1iulDXu4mrHESDaJ0atpQ">A Framework for Scalable Cognition</a></span><span>: </span><span class="c79">As attention is spreading among agents, it recruits their resources to a coordinated action. We say that challenges propagate within the population of agents along paths of influence that together form a network of influence. The propagation of challenges is analogous, at least in some aspects, to the monetary flow within a market system. Such flow abstracts the local context sensitive transactions and highlights instead the flow of the money of influence and the value of attention. This is based on the understanding that attention represents the value (for the agent) of resources necessary for effective action. Effective action in turn gains influence that further draws attention. </span></p><p class="c9"><span>We&rsquo;ve develop easy to use modeling canvas for cashflows and value programming that solves 3 problems:</span></p><ul class="c15 lst-kix_si4h2qj6chf2-0 start"><li class="c9 c19"><span>Understanding for investors</span></li><li class="c9 c19"><span>Understanding for teams</span></li><li class="c9 c19"><span>Understanding for community</span></li></ul><p class="c9"><span>Than any venture investor begin to evaluate product generally he asks 3 simple questions:</span></p><ul class="c15 lst-kix_r7gcywrx0uze-0 start"><li class="c9 c19"><span>Why they&rsquo;ll use it... or What is the value of your product for audiences? If he understand the value, satisfied with volume of audience and see uniqueness &nbsp;he asks second question:</span></li><li class="c9 c19"><span>Show me the money.. or What is business model of product? If he find money he want to ensure that implementation has low risks. So he asks third:</span></li><li class="c9 c19"><span>Team and technology stack... If he believe in team or/and technology he will invest.</span></li></ul><p class="c9"><span>That logic formed the basis of modeling canvas with one simple but revolutionary improvement - with cryptocurrency technology we can program cashflows from/to particular address. So let me introduce it.</span></p><p class="c9"><span>Cybernetic modeling canvas could be defined as model that describes value flows between internal (superagents inside products) and external (audiences) environments of global brain.</span></p><h3 class="c9 c16"><a name="h.hxguloeel6jx"></a><span>Input/Output</span></h3><p class="c9"><span>As mentioned above economy of global brain could be divided to external and internal environment. Both could be subdivided to make your intelligent mechanism works more efficient.</span></p><ul class="c15 lst-kix_nw5931micxr7-0 start"><li class="c9 c19"><span>Products - try to find balance dividing what you do to several products. In the core of framework is return on investments, so it depends on brain meaning how to structure what he does. Though there is best practise to follow principles:</span></li></ul><ul class="c15 lst-kix_nw5931micxr7-1 start"><li class="c9 c40"><span>Every product has its own shares.</span></li><li class="c9 c40"><span>Every product has its own paper.</span></li><li class="c9 c40"><span>Every product has at least one core development, one marketing and one product evangelist.</span></li><li class="c9 c40"><span>One domain - one product.</span></li><li class="c9 c40"><span>Every product has clear input/output with audiences.</span></li></ul><ul class="c15 lst-kix_nw5931micxr7-0"><li class="c9 c19"><span>Audience - necessity of segmenting your audience stems from the fact that the most successful products follow platfrom principle automagicaly matching needs of several audiences. Clear understanding of what values brought to each is key factor for success. So it should be modeled.</span></li></ul><h3 class="c9 c16"><a name="h.g4dr079f3pzg"></a><span>Value flows</span></h3><p class="c9"><span>The following list is not exhaustive and was born as result of cyber&bull;Fund global brain modeling. Future global brains could expand this classification for example with cost-based approach.

Using metaphor we can divide any superagent into two types - nonliving or fully automated (artificial agents: contracts and nodes) and living that is semiautomated (biological agents or communities).</span></p><p class="c9"><span>Biological superagents could be logically structured as (indirect analogy from finance are profit centers and cost centers):</span></p><ul class="c15 lst-kix_s4cefjtnpjht-0 start"><li class="c9 c19"><span>Brain parts or decision centers - analogy is board of directors. In global brains decision centers accumulate cashflows and reinvest them in accordance with agreements of shareholders based on incentives that comes from community.</span></li><li class="c9 c19"><span>Bodies or work centers - analogy is departments. Bodies responsible for any particular or regular task solving. They received investments from decision centers and responsible for ROI of this investments. They are like bodies in our organism.</span></li></ul><p class="c9"><span>In accordance with our vision core bodies are (though everybody can use creative power to invent yours for particular tasks): </span></p><ul class="c15 lst-kix_xhm1fb3o7ij-0 start"><li class="c9 c19"><span>Marketing or lungs - efficiency of sources and funnels.</span></li><li class="c9 c19"><span>Development or heart - creating of code.</span></li><li class="c9 c19"><span>Product or soul - &nbsp;is client representative that form the community and find balance between development and marketing.</span></li></ul><p class="c9"><span>Continuous purpose of brain parts and bodies to automate tasks and operations pushing it to artificial agents.

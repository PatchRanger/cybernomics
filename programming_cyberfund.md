* Max Uvarov
* Dmitry Sadovnychyi
* Vladimir Savin
Genesis neurons serves as starting trust network through cyber•Fund global brain creation. The need for Genesis team caused by necessity of the body who responsible for initial investments and leading cyber•Fund to birth. Cyber•Fund designed to be implemented fully independent from Genesis team eventually.

### Communications

* cyber•Fund fall in love to [Trello](https://trello.com/cyberfund). He feels that this is awesome way to build product oriented communities.
* At that moment he realized that source code will live inside [Github](https://github.com/cyberFund).

* Managing values

Through multisig wallet 3 of 5 somebody from genesis team (entropy is provided for our safety) responsible for controlling withdrawals of funds and revenue flows from core addresses (GSR and Genesis) in accordance with this paper. Though there is no multisig solution for controlling shares the same way it should be implemented as soon as possible.

### What is cyber•Shares?

### Value model
Cybernetic business model that form value for every participant of the system living in the core of cyber • Fund represented in one picture. For make it understandable it follows decomposition principle. For every product should be described low level value model.

Full size picture published in [png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9S_086dsM0HNmxmWndHQlF0OEE/edit?usp=sharing) and [svg](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9S_086dsM0HbGR3d1FQRENpN2s/edit?usp=sharing) or could be commented in Google Docs.
Cyber • Fund is mixed type of commercial and non-commercial organisation and will tend to keep this balance. But we starting from commercial functions to build in strong survival mechanism inside our structures.
Model shows that though there is a lot of science problems within industry that is [described by Vitalik](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Problems) cyber•Fund will concentrate on solving product level or consumer problems.

### Why there is no dividends?
Cyber•Fund designed for continuous development. All the profits from the cyber•Fund are to be reinvested in existing and new products (look the Road Map) or to be invested in cyber•Pie, in product the main purpose of which to maximize capitalization in Bitcoins. Therefore all profits will be reinvest in growth of cyber•Fund that will reflect on the growth of cyber•Fund capitalization namely increase in the value of shares. Google use the same strategy. They have never paid dividends, and all income earned reinvest in the companies growth. All dividends could be paid from product level shares.

### What is cyber?
There is a lot of terms that represents the same thing with tiny differences or no difference at all: cryptosecurity, cryptoshare, cryptotoken, cryptoasset, cryptoequity etc. We propose to use more simple and understandable term cyber for anything that represent not only crypto, but something more intelligent.
* Cyber as noun - any share in artificial intelligent network. Example: Founders will have 5% of cybers after Genesis Sale Race.
* Cyber as verb - To connect something with cyberspace. Example: There is reason to cyber this ingenious proposal.
* Cyber as adjective - To describe something as very intelligent, the most intelligent. In two years cyber girls begin to believe in automagic future proposed by cyberFund.
* Cyber as prefix - Use it to expand or empower some usual meaning of noun, verb or adjective with powerful cyber concept. For instance: cybereconomy, cybersend, cyberfast, cyberanything.

### Social consensus
According to [10 natural laws](http://wiki.bitshares.org/index.php/Ten_Natural_Laws_of_the_Crypto-Asset_Universe) of crypto asset universe there is the consensus that exists between the cyber•Fund team, cyber•Fund shareholders, and third-parties who would like to use the cyber•Fund branding, technologies and codebase. While anyone is free to use the cyber•Fund developments, one gets fully endorsed and promoted by the cyber•Fund team and the cyber•Fund community only if that developer allocates 10% to cyber•Fund as a way to honor cyber•Share holders their contributions that made the cyber•Fund developments possible.

## Core products
Without core products cyber•Fund has low chances for automagic and rapid evolving because core product are inherent components of architected cyber•Fund global brain.

### cyber•Inceptor
Problem: Local attention mechanisms of global brain into a collective attention of the group. The two problems involving the attention mechanism are of course strongly coupled. In fact they can be considered as two aspects of the same problem. The first aspect focuses on modeling the cognitive agents in functional terms without highlighting how the functional components are implemented. The second aspect is inspired by a connectionist approach that highlights the emergence of functionality, at any level, from the interactions of elements one level lower.
Solution: cyber•Inceptor - Focus and Inspiration of cyber•Fund global brain.
cyber•Inceptor is crowdfunding platform which help cybernetic companies to receive investments in exchange for shares. cyber•Inceptor is input of cybernetic economy, entrepreneurs just need to download the paper to the platform and all the community (global brain) will be Focused and Inspired.

## Birth, Infancy and so on.
Though we have huge [pack of ideas](https://docs.google.com/a/cyberfund.io/spreadsheets/d/1rks92sn8Ft_GU41q7P6VSrUHUJ5NKllYnCn4jsAuYL8/edit#gid=198127602) for future products there is no meaning to discuss it before at least successful funding and great interest from community. That is community right and responsibility to shape future of cyber•Fund developments.

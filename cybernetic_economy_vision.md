</h1><p class="c9"><span>Cybernetics economic system or CES or simply, cybereconomy - complex of existing Artificial Intelligent Networks.</span></p><p class="c9"><span>Cybereconomy is changing the main criterion for economic decision-making from the desire to increase individual capital(capitalism) and public property(socialism) to new motivation criterion equilibrium.</span></p><p class="c9"><span>Capitalism, nowadays system motivates people to accumulate equity. Successful people in that system of values &#8203;&#8203;is a person who has accumulated more capital. Exclusively personal gain makes people egoists and often motivates them to do acts only for themselves but damaging society (corruption, environmental pollution, etc.).</span></p><p class="c5"><span></span></p><p class="c5"><span></span></p><p class="c9"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 698.00px; height: 290.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image04.png" style="width: 698.00px; height: 290.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c5"><span></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Cybereconomy - is a system based on the principle of equilibrium between private and public.

For example, in 5 years. That dramatically change industry of Digital Marketing landscape. Web Analytics never felt such awesome. There was epoch of open code. That is epoch of open data. And that will help to explain and boost everything. Except one thing - what peoples do not want to open. &nbsp;Very simple. Open Data could be the most significant part of Open Source concept. Every steps inside funnels in every app or site begin to accumulate knowledges about knowing what work and what don&rsquo;t much more faster. That will dramatically reduce ability to compete inside legacy soft internet infrastructure. This is future of mixed search/referral digital marketing and the most exciting that in offline also. Every referral link can be visible and private. And that is really cool feature that industry is waiting for.

Every approach seems to be very efficient and probably after testing on different levels engineers could find solution that combine all 3 approaches that is much more intelligent. The last one model already works in BitsharesX and other two models is just some Ethereum contracts. There is no doubt that in 3 years there will be pack of strong algorithms and apps for managing almost any country in much more intelligent way. That is shock but all existing governments has no chances to exist and that is only the matter of time than changes begin to happen. May be governments will manage to evolve for new principles. Probably some governments will continue fool people for a ride instilling fears about terrorism, cybercrime, biological weapons or something else. Nobody knows yet.

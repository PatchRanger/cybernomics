# Cybernetic economy vision

Cybernetics economic system or CES or simply, cybereconomy - complex of existing Artificial Intelligent Networks.

Cybereconomy is changing the main criterion for economic decision-making from the desire to increase individual capital(capitalism) and public property(socialism) to new motivation criterion equilibrium.
Capitalism, nowadays system motivates people to accumulate equity. Successful people in that system of values ​​is a person who has accumulated more capital. Exclusively personal gain makes people egoists and often motivates them to do acts only for themselves but damaging society (corruption, environmental pollution, etc.).

Cybereconomy - is a system based on the principle of equilibrium between private and public. The profitability of the system proved by existence of [Nash Equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium). Cybereconomy is already exists in the world of Open Source software. This logic of production seems absurd from the point of view of capitalism. Involvement and social control in the economic and technological development processes by decentralizing decision-making in economic development planning between participants in the economic process. Cybernetic business framework change the system labor organization from centralized system to decentralized.

The new economy some people define as cryptoeconomy. That definition reflects only one component, while cybernetic economy is more comprehensive definition. Cybereconomy nobody saw for 6 years. While in fact cybereconomy is much more intelligent by design than any existing industry:
* ability to [learn](https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate?timespan=all&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=) dramatically fast. Like nothing learn before,
* ability to [growth](https://blockchain.info/charts/market-cap?timespan=all&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=) much more faster than anything existed before,
* ability to [reproduce spices](http://coinmarketcap.com/) is fantastic,
* ability to [survive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) seems to be almost immortal through distributed nature.

Existence of cybereconomy is surprisingly for humanity. But that is much more exciting than autonomous strong AI existence. Global brains confront mankind with many new dilemmas right now. But anyway the only way to perceive them is just to accept.

## Artificial Intelligent Networks
World economy growth increase year after year. What factors could push world economy growth even faster?

Wikipedia keeps comprehensive [list of emerging technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emerging_technologies) that сould predetermine this boom. Cryptocurrencies is just one of diffusing technologies there. But if we assume that artificial intelligent network technology could lead to strong artificial intelligence faster and could empower emergence of almost any technology from the list we can state that hyperbolic economic growth is possible and wait the planet in next 10 years. That is logic to forecasting growth of peoples faith in artificial intelligent networks with unbelievable pace disrupting industry after industry multiplying human wealth.

It could be more pessimistic than in the table with “help” of governments, but generally these pace in accordance with principles of system dynamics is inevitable. That is very interesting for me to look on media. Especially how they will explain all this stuff for peoples.
If we assume that any problem could be solved with AIN technology and this is the only industry that will form future economy there is 4 applied industry that will spin cybernetic economy:

### Science is the Power
Science will growth much more faster. With cybernetic business framework every published science paper in case of existence of meaning will find enough power to prove itself forming new economy within particular community becoming live not only in code, but inside peoples brains and inside chipsets of robots.

### Digital Development
The faith of soft industry will broke in two divisions - the code that live and code that cannot live. So simple. Anybody with [Github](https://github.com/) could replicate or improve any existing systems and create new. That code will predetermine absolutely everything.

### Digital Marketing
Funny Cookies will evolve to Public Keys. For example, in 5 years. That dramatically change industry of Digital Marketing landscape. Web Analytics never felt such awesome. There was epoch of open code. That is epoch of open data. And that will help to explain and boost everything. Except one thing - what peoples do not want to open.  Very simple. Open Data could be the most significant part of Open Source concept. Every steps inside funnels in every app or site begin to accumulate knowledges about knowing what work and what don’t much more faster. That will dramatically reduce ability to compete inside legacy soft internet infrastructure. This is future of mixed search/referral digital marketing and the most exciting that in offline also. Every referral link can be visible and private. And that is really cool feature that industry is waiting for. Digital marketing with Referral•Funnel•Conversion model also the key for understanding learning mechanisms of global brains.

### Digital Engineering
That is all about building [hard part](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5AnWzjHtWA) of our story. Boston Dynamics creates robots one after one, Google have got approve for testing robotic cars in some states. Drones already prohibited in USA national parks. Remember about open-source. Creating robots for our children could be not harder than [Lego constructor](http://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/?domainredir=mindstorms.lego.com). How these all army of robots could be managed without cryptographic proof? The short answer. Peoples will understand that without stronger intelligence impossible to control this whole army of heartless machines.

## Governments
All functions of governments could be automated very fast in very intelligent way. The most promising models are: [Holacracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holacracy), [Futarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futarchy) and [Liquid democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy). Every approach seems to be very efficient and probably after testing on different levels engineers could find solution that combine all 3 approaches that is much more intelligent. The last one model already works in BitsharesX and other two models is just some Ethereum contracts. There is no doubt that in 3 years there will be pack of strong algorithms and apps for managing almost any country in much more intelligent way. That is shock but all existing governments has no chances to exist and that is only the matter of time than changes begin to happen. May be governments will manage to evolve for new principles. Probably some governments will continue fool people for a ride instilling fears about terrorism, cybercrime, biological weapons or something else. Nobody knows yet. But lets us imagine how existing Roman Law could evolve?

### Law
Instead of paper law that is hard to write, accept and maintain in every legislative system of any country - crypto law is much more efficient and works and learn automagicaly with software engineering. So there is strong demand for Legal frameworks for transitions.

### Execution
Instead of legacy execution system there is much more smart way: Hard. Robots and Algorithms ability to precise execution is more comprehensive than humans. That is obvious.

### Justice
Justice inside every existing brain. Very cool feature of our future.

## Businesses
With bunch of opportunities for cyber entrepreneurs area of money making could be changed. Though 1st wave of information technology significantly reduce demand on blue collars with automation of easy tasks distributed nature of global brains leaves no chances for white. Future there corporation of peoples who own small pieces of giant multi trillion global brains within retail, service or production industries looks very close.  This corporations could be founded right now by you. That is dramatically change the paradigm of small businesses - small but global. That is all doesn't mean that small businesses has no chances to survive. Vice versa - new emerging markets of intelligence is empty land for millions of new ideas.

## Society
Impossible to predict. But that is clear that religions and politics could be abandoned in only 1 generations and totaly forget in 2 generations of our children’s. Great insights you can find [here](http://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/last-c-2014-global-brain-and-the-future-of-human-society2.pdf).
We believe that our planet will solve all incoming dilemmas to realise the biggest dream of humanity.

## Space Industry
Almost everybody dream to go to space. After solving huge pack of human problems the most exciting industry is Space. Pioneers [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk), [Bas Lansdorp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bas_Lansdorp) and [Arno Wielders](http://www.mars-one.com/about-mars-one/team) already begin to build awesome products. Armed with new kind of intelligence humanity would be able to step into new epoch of Great Space Exploration.

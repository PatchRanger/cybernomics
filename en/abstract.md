# Abstract

Intelligence - that is what humanity all the road excited the most. But what the intelligence is? Intelligence is very complicated. But obvious that intelligence is the ability to learn for survival. Some guys are still saying that Darwin Law is not the Science. Okey! That is their inborn right:-) But now with Science we know that such guys have much more less chances to survive. That is it. That is nature.

Cybernetics as a science have began to evolve from [Norbert Wiener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener) defined it in 1948. There is thousands of researches that solve problems in closed systems in any aspect of existence, especially economic systems. In 1958 [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) have supposed that computers programmable by peoples can solve any existing problem. Today we all understand that this is true. Computing system is everywhere helping people to solve problems. But stored-program concept still did not solve the problem of self-consciousness. In 2008 [Satoshi Nakomoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) have proposed [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). The first system that has inborn ability to form self-organized closed economy system that cryptographically prove existence of itself. Bitcoin solves problem of trustless communications in closed system. In 2013 year ago [David R. Weinbaumin](http://be.linkedin.com/in/weaver9) defined global brains in the paper [A Framework for Scalable Cognition](https://fe5f942c-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/gbialternative1/A%20framework%20for%20scalable%20cognition.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7coWr4RVENZFIpG0mGHUgOTsJn1IA5hsnReqivEnUphfVKvTX5aeRyns7W74leREGgVeZNbqzlMZyzSocv83y-_ldV2BsdewMEz7yKcOEdoruOVGul1G1fD06KEkXWIuWSF5WwPpi4Qe6YedKMUoxT6bOzE0FTEA4AkaZfbWlGK8OFOkKIP0BhD8NmKnpVsK9p2NME4BBsKIy2vWjFJqdr4D6Rd53ATYZQj8E5lzvmJsK0hKtq3KeUrUIZdezNuHFSIPhlJQ&attredirects=2). He defined almost everything concerning global brains except one thing - implementation. This paper is effort to connecting all the dots moving cybernetics and global brains further to more applicable space: [cryptocurrency networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency), [internet of money](http://startupboy.com/2013/11/07/bitcoin-the-internet-of-money/), of [things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things) and everything. We propose to evolve existing economic system to new generation cybernetic economic system by solving one of the most excited problem ever existed.

<span style="color:red">Problem</span>: Solve problems with infinite efficiency.

<span style="color:yellow">Solution</span>: Problem of efficiency could be solved by creating artificial intelligent networks (AIN) on top of emerging cryptocurrency infrastructure by means of Cybernetic Business Framework (CBF).

CBF acts as community generated Body of Knowledge for implementing cybernetic theory and cryptocurrency best practices into disruptive planet scale products that infinitely more efficient than existing industries.

<span style="color:blue">Hypothesis</span>: Global brains will absorb any existing industry growing in capitalization 10 times every 24 months. To prove this hypothesis cyber&bull;Fund has been created by this paper. For balancing existing cybereconomy and make it more meaningful this paper describes proof-of-origin paradigm.

We can simply describe our proposals as system there is people that:
- program peoples continuously think about meaningful efficiency of anything
- motivating them to program computers to automatically prove anything
- program another peoples to participate in this process.

That will lead existing legacy economy to cybernetic economy there exist nothing-to-proof after singularity world. But that is another part of story. The purpose of this paper is to shed some light on how that all happens, exist and will evolve.

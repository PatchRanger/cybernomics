## Before Artificial Intelligence
There is a lot interesting stuff in history of human civilisation. Let me remember the most important events that have form mindsets inside existing economic system. That is just 3 major events. But that is how contemporary [Religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion), [Politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics) and [World economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy) came.
### Roman Law. ~449 BC
Roman Law was ingenious in terms of community intelligence or politics with [separation of powers principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers). 3 branches: Executive, Legislative and Judicial. That system works with slight differences in the core of any existing nation level systems. This systems was born too early and peoples was in need with something much more simple to Trust. Trust = Capitalization with weak proof. Maybe that is why:
### Jesus birth. ~AC
Every time something happens that make new belief. [Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus) give the world one strong concept that widespread the planet: Faith. Though faith could be defined as belief that is not based on [proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_(truth). But that was faith for good. History of religions is obvious cause human was need something to believe even he couldn't explain this. And that was great. That was moved the Science forward. Why? Because religion is ingenious in terms of business modeling. Faith generated revenue automagicaly for centuries. People bring money themselves. Faith = Capitalization without proof. Such religion. So much wow. But people became smarter century after century making politics more powerful than religion. Why? Because peoples have learned to trust.
### Fractional Banking Reserving. ~1600 AC
Nature abhors a vacuum. Almost 400 years ago those guys who had power and accumulate some trust find very tricky way to create money in large scales: via banks and [fractional reserving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_reserve_banking). That was inception of Esprit de corps - the system there monopolies found way to utilize trust to create values or money in large scales. These monopolies: governments and [central banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_central_banks) exist today and they have unique right to create money from nothing. Such banks, so much governments. If you want to create money from nothing you should ask. Trust = Capitalization with strong proof.
## After Artificial Intelligence
### Agreement. January 3, 2009
Satoshi Nakamoto and blockchain technology proof the concept that there is no need to trust at all in any type of economic relations. ~~Faith~~, ~~Trust~~, Certainty = Capitalization with cryptographic proof. That is groundbreaking change in terms of community intelligence. After 5 years of Bitcoin existence there is obvious that this type of self-organized systems is efficient and survival and capitalization pace prove it. But the most exciting that Agreement has been reached not only between humans. That is ready to use infrastructure for economic relations with results of emerging [strong AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) technology and animals through disruptive [brain-computer interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface).

<span style="color:blue">Hypothesis</span>: Artificial intelligent networks is the only way to find agreement between humans, animals (biological intelligence) and robots (artificial intelligence).

That is all not about good or evil. That is all about Intelligence and Science. And that is the only way to control emerging power of community or global intelligence instead of governments will control everybody through system like [Prism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program). That is a dilemma of Humanity. But that is hint: The truth is not in Private or Public. The truth is in Private and Public. Choice what make public or what leave private is inborn right or feature of anything that have intelligence. That is Intelligence. So predictions of [cyberpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk) evangelists become probable with each passing day.
### Enlightenment. 20 September, 2014
Smart peoples have [predicted](http://blog.kareldonk.com/the-global-brain/) that one day The Internet self-aware itself. Self-consciousness as necessary component of strong AI is still unsolved. This paper explain how to perceive any artificial intelligent network as global brain. Modern computing also begins from mainframes. Let us imagine global brains as mainframes and strong AI as modern microprocessors. We will use intelligence of global brains to continuously explore themselves to [build smaller models](http://researchweb.watson.ibm.com/cognitive-computing/neurosynaptic-chips.shtml#fbid=RR9uP55_GYC) of strong AI. That kind of intelligence will lead us to more intelligent economy - cybereconomy.

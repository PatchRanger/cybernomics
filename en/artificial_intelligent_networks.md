# Artificial intelligent networks

Artificial Intelligent Network or AIN or, simply, global brain - cybernetic system which follows 6 fundamental principles: existence of meaning, cryptographic proof, digital value, efficient communications, self-consciousness and equilibrium. First AIN ever existed is Bitcoin. For 5 years of Bitcoin existence was born 500 AINs only in visible part of [Digital Universe](http://coinmarketcap.com/). For simplicity let us define any AIN as [global brain](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/SUPORGLI.html) with understanding that AIN is significantly more perceived than previous perception of global brains concept.

But how can we define something as intelligent if there is no common definition of what the intelligence is? If we assume that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency systems is global brains and just summarize all founded patterns we can try to define it. And the most exciting that the same definition could be applied to intelligence in general no matter is it artificial or biological. Let us try? Intelligence is an entity self-aware itself with existence of meaning by proving these meaning through finding values via efficient communications and tending to equilibrium :-)

Simple case: typical white collar. He wakes up early in the morning. 

* Why? He wants to take care of his family (Meaning).
* How? He needs to go to work (Proof). 
* Purpose? He wants to earn money (Values). 
* Means? Through (Efficient communications). 
* Meaning? To survive and eventually reach harmony (Equilibrium). 

Simple? And there is self-consciousness? Self-consciousness makes that all works. Try to reflect about yourself. That is how systems like Bitcoin works. Comes to mind popular joke from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: [What is the answer to life the universe and everything?](https://www.google.ru/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=what is the answer to life the universe and everything) We still do not want to accept that the only meaning is harmony or equilibrium. There is natural mechanism within our intelligence that force us to find our own meaning. And then meaning is found what happens? We need to prove it. We begin to earn money. But the only way to earn money is efficient communications no matters what you do. And what is the meaning in everything we do? Eventually to reach harmony. It looks like that recursive probabilistic semantic calculations in our brains induce us to find the answer that already have been found.

##Intelligence in Science

[Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography), [Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), [Economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy), [Cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics), [Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), [Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology), [Neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience) and, of course dozens years of Engineering. That is quite huge pack of Science power that lives inside Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin also ingenios in terms of [memetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics). At the beginning Satoshi published the paper. This paper was self-sufficient to find followers. After releasing a code the system begin to live by itself independently. That gives us brilliant idea that there is a way for any scientist to find a proof for any work in much more intelligent way. With Cybernetic Business Framework there is easy way to find followers for writing code together. After launching of the system theory will prove itself through the most ancient mechanism - survival. There is no followers? So there is no proof. Code does not live by itself? That is not the science. Very simple. Such approach could fill existing gap between money and science.

<span style="color:orange">Axiom</span>: The code that can live is the Science, the code that is dead - not.

Let me warm up your appetite with some sweets. You can ask - what i will get from these intelligence? For now Bitcoin is just less expensive way to transfer and store money. But let assume that in ten years:
 - 4 billion people will use cybermoney;
 - 400 million cyberassets will be issued;
 - 10 million DApss will be developed;
 - 1 mln blockchains will be exist.
Already internet penetration is about 4 mln people. Already by humanity issued more than 400 mln equities. Already in Google Play and Appstore there is more than million apps. Already there is millions of databases that are hide from the eyes.
These blockchains could keep everything we can imagine and we do not need to trust them because information was cryptographically proved and controlled by everybody. These information will be accessible through something like [Google Glass](http://www.google.com/glass/start/) or even [Emotiv](http://emotiv.com/) instantly. What happens? Yeah! That is artificial sixth sense. Sense of everything. These future is close. Everybody should understand that those who will have sixth sense will be significantly smarter.

So to be sure that all this intelligent power works for me i just need to use simple wallet for creating, storing and managing my money and shares, because i understand that this is core. That makes me [smarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_amplification). [Much more smarter](http://www.coindesk.com/tag/under-the-microscope/). Maybe that is the reason why the first guys who adopted Bitcoin was engineers and scientists? This guys always dreamt for systems like Bitcoin. And somewhere deep inside they was understood that their time has come. 

Let’s get back to core principles of artificial intelligent networks:

* Existence of meaning
* Cryptographic proof
* Cyber value
* Efficient communications
* Self-consciousness
* Equilibrium

## Existence of meaning

The core of Bitcoin like systems is what scientist call consensus. Simple?  Consensus is automated aggrement uppon something basic. That somehting could be anything. That is why in this book we will call that meaning. But stop! Bihind any consensus should be some basic idea? There was written a lot about Bitcoin and underlying technology.  But nobody tried to describe and explain what idea live inside people brains who own different coins. Let us do it. Now we can observe almost 500 embryos in different parts of visible digital space. It is very hard to understand what is in the brains of owners of every asset. But for the most promising systems task could be more obvious.

### Bitcoin
Basic idea behind Bitcoin protocol is to make fractional banking reserving meaningless. So simple. People who own bitcoins believes that the system that works in the whole world economy will be disrupted. More over. These people understand that more people use bitcoins and believes in the same concept more value they have. Also simple. More people believes => The more bitcoin economy => More people believes. You can ask - there is the end? Simple answer - the end is in the end of existing economic, political and religious system. And these fact is forecastable for everybody who understand [system dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_dynamics) principles because Bitcoin has very [positive feedback loop](http://blog.pmarca.com/2014/01/22/why-bitcoin-matters/) and like the internet almost 100% retention. But that is the only beginning.

### Ripple
In fact Ripple is not AIN becouse it doesnt have blockchain - data stored on federated servers. But it can think - there is fast and scalable consensus algorythm which allow netwrok agree on huge scope in transactions very fast. Basic concept behind [Ripple](https://ripple.com/ripple_primer.pdf) is I owe you (IOU) concept. IOU - usual trust lines that is used by any bank then create money through debts. Ripple is asset agnostic, distributed, fast and cool. Creator of Ripple Jed McCaleb was execute Bitcoin program and encapsulated some Bitcoin meaning to Ripple. Owners of XRP think that any existing asset (currency, commodity, etc) could be reissued by gateways through rippling. Crypto community do not like Ripple because it is not true crypto. What everybody should understand is that Ripple will do a big job in transformation of economy as a bridge between fiat and crypto world. Ripple is compliant. That is the key.

### Next
[Next](http://wiki.nxtcrypto.org/wiki/Whitepaper:Nxt) was born with forging concept in mind. That was first fully original solution and the most exciting thing that owners of Next don’t believe in mining at all. That is why Next was born as mining free proof of stake. Every network participant forge transactions. That makes system faster, more reliable and the most important - switches from proof of work that waste energy.

### MaidSafe
Basic concept behind [MaidSafe](https://github.com/maidsafe/Whitepapers/blob/master/Project-Safe.md) is to make available server free publishing of anything with automagic commercialisation. Also very simple. After launching of MaidSafe network owners will begin to disrupt existing internet structures. You can ask - why are you sure that their efforts will be successful? Answer is simple - efficiency. Imagine that you is developer. You can write an app, push it to the network and forget about it. That app will just works and just earn money. Automagicaly because system was architected with ultimate reliability and simple monetization in mind.

### Bitshares
Basic concept behind [Bitshares](https://docs.google.com/a/cyberfund.io/document/d/1RLcjSXWuU9vBJzzqLEXVACSCdn8zXKTTJRN_LfoCjNY/edit) was to make [Decentralised Autonomious Corporation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_Autonomous_Organization) that will produce another Decentralised Autonomious Corporations. Every owner of Bitshares already think about disrupting some industries. [Bitshares](http://bit.ly/1qIVBP2) solve problem of governance in POS systems by implementing delegated mechanism of adjusting key parametrs of tha system. Also these kind of liqud democracy solves problem of forging centralization. There is another big thing behind Bitshares. Guys implement [market peg](http://wiki.bitshares.org/index.php/Market_Peg) concept that could solve problem of moving existing infrustructure of derevative finance to cyberassets using prediction markets. From this point of view Bitshares is strong competitor to Ripple and IOU concept. Bitshares also strong competitor to Bitcoin itself as BitShares network 100x cost effective to maintain and this gap goes to development of the network.

### Ethereum
One of strongest concept behind [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper) is contracts. Etherem will allow to create small autonomous proggrams that interract with each other. People who own ethers believe that code can work autonomously if somebody will pay for these code. So if you’ll see on the street robot with rocket launcher all you could know is that somebody had pay for it. Maybe another robot. Nobody knows. But there is no way to stop it.

<span style="color:orange">Axiom</span>: While the code can work, the code will work while at least 1 mind believe in this code.

### Cyber•Shares
Basic concept behind cyber•Fund is to develop artificial intelligent networks or global brains infrastructure. So everybody who own cyber•Shares think about disrupting any existing industry forming millions of global brains that will be interconnected with each other in new age cybereconomy. First step is creating the industry of polymorphic decentralise applications (DApps) that interract with any existing AIN and 

### Skycoin
[Skycoin](https://github.com/skycoin/whitepapers) is the most exciting AIN concept. Everybody saw Terminator. Everybody remember [Skynet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)). That is what Skycoin owners keep in their brains (of course without wars). First step - building the most powerful [meshnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking) to disrupt cellular and ISP companies. How? Everybody have cells in their pockets. By directing packets directly from one of more than 1 bln cellular phone to another last mile of internet infrastructure tends to be disrupted.

### In search of meaning
These list of system is not exhausted.  Thousands of engineers [try to find](http://coinmarketcap.com/) their own meaning. Cyber•Fund is happy that he is not alone and will do its best to help them.

## Cryptographic proof
Though [public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) is not new and is in fact one of the most complicated topic the whole internet works based on it. I’ll try to use maybe stupid analog to explain what is cryptographic proof and how it could be related with intelligence.

Everybody have 5 senses. Do you believe your ears, eyes, skin, nose and tongue? Or you trust them? Or you certain? Why? Just think about it one minute.

If there was a way to turn off four of them your certainty about what happens significantly decrease. But everybody knows what happens then we sleep. Than we sleep all our feelings are switched off and we lose sense of reality. So we can conclude that there is some more fundamental proof within our intelligence that prove reality for us. Though there is no way to find out what proof exist in the core of our mind we can find some answers looking to some artificial intelligent networks that already exist and more visible.

### Fundamental proofs
If intelligent system can live autonomously with only one proof that proof is fundamental.

[Proof of work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) or POW - firstly implemented in Bitcoin. There is lot reflections concerning meaning of POW. But still does not obvious why it is works. [Network effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect). Ok. Why Satoshi choose it? That is stupid energy consumption. Or not? May be that is pursuit of calculation (intelligent) power instead of military (physical). Or maybe that is fairness of initial distribution? Nonetheless - no song, no supper.

[Proof of stake](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_Stake) or POS - firstly implemented in Next. Mainstream energy efficient proof. Cons is fairness of initial distribution. Already begin to evolve. [Delegated POS](http://bitshares.org/delegated-proof-of-stake/) implemented in BitsharesX try to solve problem of centralization.

[Proof of resource](https://www.maidsafe.org/t/proof-of-resource-formal-specification/519) - Proof of resource is very crude concept. Though it looks very promising at the time of writing the paper there was no math-based evidence that this could work.

### Derivative proofs
[Proof of existence](http://www.proofofexistence.com/) - without proving of work or stake there is no way to prove the existence. Irony? Proof of existence is great case that shows that derivative proofs are the future of intelligent development. Just imagine! Simple algorithm can disrupt all notary services. How? You upload file => Hash is calculated => Sent transaction with hash to Bitcoin or any other reliable network. Profit! You have cryptographic evidence that certain file have been existed in exact moment of time. More over! Everybody can be sure that authorship is yours. Forever! 

[Proof of excellence](http://peercoin.net/assets/paper/peercoin-paper.pdf) - another case that was implemented in [Peercoin](http://peercoin.net/). It uses combined POS and POW with idea that system intelligently find balance. Though these concept could be strong there is no clear math-based evidence that these approach is efficient. 

Existing cyberindestry more focused on developing anonymous systems despite there is huge opportunity in development more intelligent system that can proof more. Ideas?

### Probabilistic proofs
There is great paper [Probabilistic Proof Systems: A Primer](http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/PS/pps5.pdf) of Oded Goldreich. That is the future of decision making using global brains. It is hard to imagine what intelligence could be developed implementing these ready to use technology.

## Cyber value

A lot of interesting things appears if the got as assumption that Bitcoin works like usual brain. But what the value is? Wikipedia [tell us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(economics)) that economic value is a measure of the benefit provided by a good or service to an economic agent. Okey. But how these value appear on “atomic” level? Let me remember about [Bitcoin genesis block](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block). After genesis block was created Satoshi became richer on 50 bitcoins. Truth? No. Why? Because nobody value these 50 bitcoins except Satoshi. Than these value appears? Then Satoshi [sent 10 bitcoins](https://blockchain.info/block-index/15019/00000000d1145790a8694403d4063f323d499e655c83426834d4ce2f8dd4a2ee) to [Hal Finney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Finney_(cypherpunk)) (we’ll wait you man). How that could happens? Because Hal was running bitcoin client. Some energy was wasted, work was proved and value have been appeared for Satoshi and Hal. There was some common meaning for each.

<span style="color:orange">Axiom</span>: Value appears then some meaning is proved

Another argument in a Bitcoin piggy bank. [Double-entry bookkeeping system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system) that was born 5 centuries ago is in the core of existing financial and economic system. All existing values live in databases within these simple principle. No wonder why it is in the core of Bitcoin protocol. That fact makes understanding of new generation protocols easier by all existing professionals.

Technically everything that could be valuable live in cryptocurrency networks in tokens. That’s just passwords that doesn’t store anywhere in raw format except people brains (forget about bad apps that control you Private key). That’s the only reason why people say about this kind of systems as trustless systems. But we use to think about value as something that has certain legally-physical form: money, asset, currency, equity, property or whatever you like. In cybereconomy the only difference between different types of value in program logic of the value. Every type of value programmed to behave like physical analog. That is the most interesting part of our story. Property was something that drove humanity all the road. But how tokens could be perceived as true property?

### Cybermoney
The most important thing in user adoption is to explain how basic public-key cryptography works in Bitcoin. After understanding everything become obvious. That is like enlightenment moment for everybody. My explanation how it is works in 5 easy steps:

1. Than you create your wallet very loooong password is generated and shows only for you. This is your Private key. It doesn't store anywhere. That is the only information you need to keep for having access to your money. That is your password and this is your money and values. You can store your money even in your brain keeping Private key there!
2. Public key it is a number. Like your bank account. You can show it everywhere to send money. Public key stores everywhere and everybody can see it. Public key is calculated from your Private key using special formula or algorithm so there is no efficient way to calculate it back. That is just a math.
3. Then you want to spend your money you sign your spending with your Private key and send transaction to network. Network check that you have this money that you declare to send and that you do not want to spend your money twice.
4. All spending records live in database signed by every participant with their Private keys as indestructible сhain of blocks. And this database (blockchain) is storing and automatically synchronizing with almost every participant of a system. So blockchain is just exist and accessible for everybody.
5. The whole system is open source, there is no emission center and there is nobody to trust. 

That simple explanation works. Even my mom have managed. She is 64. So then somebody understand how trustless system works and that this system is just a math he or she begin to perceive bitcoins as medium of exchange. This is first important step in user adoption.

The second step is much more exciting: possession and perception as store of value. My experience shows that after trying bitcoins and ensuring how easy and cool to feel full control of your money Bitcoin could be begin to perceived as store of value. That fact could turn on cognitive processes of property possession. We need to ensure that it could be used as store of value. What arguments could be here? 

Simple explanation is users. Everybody knows that Facebook is 200 bln USD company because it has more than 1 bln user. That is simple math. Bitcoin has ~2 mln. users and capitalized in ~8 bln USD. Also simple math. The internet has more than 3 bln users. Also simple. Everybody who use internet can use Bitcoin right now. Try to calculate capitalisation yourself adding network effects. Simplicity, transparency and perspective shoot any questions concerning perception as store of value and turn on the most exciting cognitive processes: perception as capitalization growther. That fact dramatically change behavior of intelligent agent. Key factor that intelligent agent understand that more people use Bitcoin, the more capitalization it has. So everybody who possess bitcoins promote it. Otherwise not. That gives me brilliant idea that Bitcoin being digital property change behaviour like land or real estate. 

<span style="color:orange">Axiom:</span> Cyberproperty change human behavior like the physical one.

Bitcoin as medium of exchange and store of value is more clear for those who possess it.  But this is just first two steps of adaption. There is at least 3 more: perception as capitalization growther, revenue generator and agent that works.

### Cybershares
How could something growth in capitalization if it doesn't work as medium of exchange and store of value? Again simple answer! It should generate revenue.

3 things: [proof-of-existence](http://www.proofofexistence.com/), cybernetic business framework and proof-of-origin described by this paper later makes cryptotokens excellently function as tool for revenue generation and growthing of value. Cybershares is the next big thing that could shake billion of existing businesses working as strong motivation for entrepreneurs contribute to global intelligence remaining certain about reliability of system, present and future value. Intelligent agents who understand this begin to perceive digital or cybershares as property with all inherent consequences of changing behaviour.

### Cyberproperty
Flexibility and reliability that gives us public-key cryptography gives us one more brilliant idea. It could be used as tool for controlling emerging zoo of robots no matter hardware or software. In fact this is further future. At least then Ethereum came. But in terms of agent perception through process of adoption understanding that intelligent networks could be suppliers of artificial agents (software or hardware) is strong factor that drives cognitive process of entrepreneurship capabilities to the sky. 

### Intangibility vs tangibility
Liquidity and accessibility for everybody makes new generation intangible or cybervalues at least not less viable than tangible. But the most promising thing that public-key simplicity for access and cashflow management will lead that any stuff like cars, homes, robots, phones, screens, music players and even land plots could be with its own public address. So no reason to choose between tangibility and intangibility. Сombination of both.

<span style="color:blue">Hypothesis:</span> All existing property will evolve to cyberproperty.

So we can conclude that digital value is inherent part of artificial intelligent networks that turns on essential cognitive processes among intelligent agents.

## Efficient Communications

Everybody love to communicate. That is the reason why the internet became so popular. Though [informational entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)) is also very complicated topic its obvious that entropy reduction in communication is significant source of efficiency in economic relations. We distinguish 3 key principles that is used in cryptocurrency networks, available today and  in fact is root of emerging efficiency of global brains.

### Peer to peer
Anybody could communicate with anybody without third parties peer to peer. Bitcoin and any future intelligent networks will follow this principle. Restriction access to information and ability to communicate significantly increase entropy of any communication and as result reduce intelligence capabilities. 

### Open Data
[Block chain](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain) - the big thing behind it is practical solution to [Byzantine general problem](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/byz.pdf). That was big problem of trustless communications. Solution of this problem could have so huge impact that consequently eliminate any meaning of wars. Using simple words it is more efficient to outwit enemy than trying to brute force.  But block chain has at least one impactful side effect - [open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data). In recent years interest in open data concept has increased significantly because data is bottomless pit for improvement efficiency of anything. Then data is open it is mean that anybody have opportunity to improve efficiency. That concept that anybody have ability to know everything significantly reduce informational entropy in planet scale.

Existing internet industry have one big stumbling block to flourish open data concept - open users or intelligent agents data. Every domain control their own user base and behavioral data through cookies. Also Google control this dataset inasmuch as [Universal Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) lives in almost 80% of the internet domains. So the biggest problem now is cookies. How to liberate the internet? Easy answer - replace cookies with public keys. But how to motivate site owners to switch to concept of open user data? How to explain this concept for peoples who use it? Again simple answer - efficiency. Site owners can easily switch to public keys complementing their web apps with disruptive digital property capabilities and users could accept this approach because new generation apps have capabilities that legacy apps don't have. Moreover - new generation apps are cheaper and in fact erase border between user, shareholder, customer etc. If you use some app - you is the integral part of it. That is big thing. Win to win. 

Public Key instead of cookies - that is very innovative concept. What this mean for peoples, business, developers and marketers? That mean that digital marketing will dramatically evolve in parallel with finance to more open and free internet. In existing digital marketing the first step in funnels is a user acquisition. Registering all users in blockchains will affect digital marketing landscape with unbelievable consequences: transparent, open and accurate world scale audience and no millions of passwords for every site. In case of this scenario come true real-time bidding ([RTB](http://bit.ly/1p3TDET)) can evolve to one of the biggest markets ever existed. So open data is strong factor that will crash existing digital marketing landscape. Open click-level data will allow global brains to optimise funnels steps with amazing speed and quality. There is no chances to compete with projects that use this approach course efficiency of such approach is obvious and could be even more powerful than Open source.

<span style="color:blue">Hypothesis:</span> Public Key will replace cookies in all browsers in 5 years.

cyber•Fund will prove this hypothesis by developing [Jah](https://github.com/cyberFund/Jah) - embeddable open wallet that supports any type of digital property.

### Open Source
Open source is phenomenon for which we should be grateful to [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds). Existing internet works on Linux, we have Linux in our pockets (android), Linux is everywhere.  Though Windows is still leading desktop OS that is not opensource we all should understand that we use browsers like Firefox and Chromium that are open source. Evolution of software proves us that open is much more intelligent and survival than closed. So that is matter of very short time than any software will be open source. [Github](https://github.com/) already has been accumulated huge human knowledges how things could automagicaly works.  Analyzing software evolution we can conclude that open source is unshakable pillar in emerging global intelligence.

## Self-consciousness

Self-consciousness is cool feature of intelligence, but it doesn't appear from the moment then living creature was born. That system appears after complicated learning process. Analyzing cryptocurrency networks in terms of global brain concept, we come to a surprising inference. Global brain is able self-aware itself through self-awareness of every neuron (human or intelligent agent) as the integral part of global brain. The next question could be somewhat: what is the reason for every neuron (human or intelligent agent) to behave these way? Windmills of [Nash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash,_Jr.) mind already found the answer:

## Equilibrium

Though [almost every science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_types_of_equilibrium) has defined balanced state of the system, existing human social-economy system still do not have strict definition applied to cybernetics and cryptocurrencies. Let me assume that the reason for neurons to behave is efficiency. That is typical non-zero sum there works [Nash Equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium). So if [Bertrand Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_paradox_(economics)) is truthful we can state that understanding of meaningless to compete lead every neuron to self-aware itself as integral part of bigger system motivating them to make decisions that efficient for everybody and for itself. In these condition neuron (human) can feel harmony. Harmony between decentralised and centralised systems. Between private and public. Between dark and light. Between hard and soft. Between left and right. Between man and woman. That is all about nature there harmony between everything could be essentially efficient in the struggle for survival.
